# MammalianMethylationConsortium


This page contains all the annotation and tools generated by Mammalian Methylation Consortium to analyze generated data using Mammal40k and Mammal320 arrays:

Here are the summary of the content:
1- Genome coordinates for different species
2- R code for alignment and annotation
3- The array manifest
4- Details on probe design
5- R code for Sesame normalization
6- R code for universal pan-mammalian epigenetic clocks, universal blood epigenetic clocks, universal skin epigenetic clocks, adaptions to Illumina 450k/EPIC array, and an example dataset
7- Various tissue, sex, and species predictors for mammalian species
8- Codes used for Mammalian Network Analysis in the paper, Haghani et al. DNA Methylation Networks Underlying Mammalian Traits, Science Magazine, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abq5693
